Ant Colony Optimization and the Travelling Salesman Problem

The Travelling Salesman Problem (TSP) consists of finding the shortest tour
between n cities visiting each once only and ending at the starting point. Let
d(i,j) be the distance between cities i and j and t(i,j) the amount of pheromone
on the edge that connects i and j. t(i,j) is initially set to a small value
t(0), the same for all edges (i,j). The algorithm consists of a series of
iterations.

One iteration of the simplest ACO algorithm applied to the TSP can be summarized
as follows: (1) a set of m artificial ants are initially located at randomly
selected cities; (2) each ant, denoted by k, constructs a complete tour,
visiting each city exactly once, always maintaining a list J(k) of cities that
remain to be visited; (3) an ant located at city i hops to a city j, selected
among the cities that have not yet been visited, according to probability
p(k,i,j) = (t(i,j)^a * d(i,j)^-b) / sum(t(i,l)^a * d(i,l)^-b, all l in J(k))
where a and b are two positive parameters which govern the respective influences
of pheromone and distance; (4) when every ant has completed a tour, pheromone
trails are updated: t(i,j) = (1-p) * t(i,j) + D(t(i,j)), where p is the
evaporation rate and D(t(i,j)) is the amount of reinforcement received by edge
(i,j). D(t(i,j)) is proportional to the quality of the solutions in which (i,j)
was used by one ant or more. More precisely, if L(k) is the length of the tour
T(k) constructed by ant k, then D(t(i,j)) = sum(D(t(k,i,j)), 1 to m) with
D(t(k,i,j)) = Q / L(k) if (i,j) is in T(k) and D(t(k,i,j)) = 0 otherwise, where
Q is a positive parameter. This reinforcement procedure reflects the idea that
pheromone density should be lower on a longer path because a longer trail is
more difficult to maintain.

Steps (1) to (4) are repeated either a predefined number of times or until a
satisfactory solution has been found. The algorithm works by reinforcing
portions of solutions that belong to good solutions and by applying a
dissipation mechanism, pheromone evaporation, which ensures that the system does
not converge early toward a poor solution. When a = 0, the algorithm implements
a probabilistic greedy search, whereby the next city is selected solely on the
basis of its distance from the current city. When b = 0, only the pheromone is
used to guide the search, which would react the way the ants do it. However, the
explicit use of distance as a criterion for path selection appears to improve
the algorithm's performance. In all other optimization applications also, an
improvement in the algorithm's performance is observed when a local measure of
greed, similar to the inverse of distance for the TSP, is included into the
local selection of portions of solution by the agents. Typical parameter values
are: m = n, a = 1, b = 5, p = 0.5, t(0) = 1e-6.
